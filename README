sqlpretty is a *basic* formatter and colourizer for SQL in classic ASP.

It doesn't do a full smart parse of various SQL dialects - but does a reasonable enough job of making some fairly complex SQL statements readable.

It spits out HTML with DIV tags used to indent bracketed statements, and SPANs with class attributes to differentiate various SQL keywords.
BR and CRLFs are used to put certain keywords on new lines.

To get the colorized output, your page will need to link to the provided css file.

e.g place in the head:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/sqlpretty/sqlpretty.css"> 

You should also link to jQuery and the provided js file:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">jQuery.noConflict();</script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/sqlpretty/sqlpretty.js"></script>

The javascript is not required - but gives a much nicer result in the form of a clickable link which will hide and show the SQL.

Your ASP page should have an include line like the following:

    <!-- #include virtual="/sqlpretty/sqlpretty.inc" -->
    

Basic usage in your ASP code is just to call the sql_pretty function
e.g
        sql = "select o.*, a.*, c.* from ((addresses as a inner join orders as o on a.id=o.deliveryid) inner join () as u on o.userid=u.id) Where o.type='x' order by o.id"
        response.write sql_pretty(sql)

This would result in a link displaying "Show SQL"
When clicked, this changes to "Hide SQL" and displays the colourized output.


To avoid the brief HTML reflow flicker caused by the default visible style of the output (necessary for sensible result when javascript not being used),
make the following call just before calling sql_pretty
    sql_pretty_default_hide()
    

Multiple SQL statements can be displayed on a single page.
To differentiate all the links that would result - you can customize the 'Show SQL' / 'Hide SQL' by using the sql_pretty_named  function.
e.g
        
        response.write sql_pretty_named(sql_p,"product SQL")
        response.write sql_pretty_named(sql_c,"category SQL")
        
This would give links,  "Show product SQL" / "Hide product SQL"  and "Show category SQL" / "Hide category SQL"
